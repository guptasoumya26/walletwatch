# Clear Settlement History Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added ability for users to clear their settled history view while preserving all records in an admin-only archive table. Each user can independently clear their own view without affecting their partner's view.

## How It Works

### User Perspective
1. **Soumyansh** clicks "Clear History" → His settled items disappear from his view
2. **Anu** still sees all settled items in her view (unchanged)
3. When **Anu** clicks "Clear History" → Her view is cleared
4. Both users now see "No settled history"
5. All records safely archived in `pending_balances_archive` (admin access only)

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Changes
**New Table: `pending_balances_archive`**
- Stores complete copy of cleared settlement records
- Includes metadata: `cleared_by`, `cleared_at`, `batch_id`
- **Admin-only access** via RLS policy (service role only)
- Cannot be accessed from UI/client

**Modified Table: `pending_balances`**
- Added `cleared_for` field (UUID array)
- Tracks which users have cleared this from their view
- Example: `cleared_for: ['user-id-1']` = cleared for user 1 only
- Example: `cleared_for: ['user-id-1', 'user-id-2']` = cleared for both

#### API Endpoint
**POST `/api/pending-balances/clear-history`**
```typescript
Request: { user_id: string }
Response: {
  message: string,
  clearedCount: number,
  batchId: string
}
```

**Process:**
1. Fetch all settled balances NOT already cleared for this user
2. Generate batch ID for this clear operation
3. Archive records to `pending_balances_archive` (via supabaseAdmin)
4. Update `pending_balances.cleared_for` array with user ID
5. Return count of cleared items

#### UI Changes
**PendingBalancesList Component:**
- Added "Clear History" button next to "Settled History" header
- Filters settled balances: `WHERE NOT cleared_for.includes(current_user_id)`
- Confirmation dialog before clearing
- Success message with count of cleared items

## Data Flow Example

### Initial State
```sql
-- pending_balances table
id: abc-123
settled_at: 2025-10-01
cleared_for: null
→ Visible to: Both users
```

### After Soumyansh Clears
```sql
-- pending_balances table
id: abc-123
cleared_for: ['soumyansh-id']
→ Visible to: Anu only

-- pending_balances_archive table (NEW RECORD)
original_balance_id: abc-123
cleared_by: soumyansh-id
cleared_at: 2025-10-04 05:35:00
batch_id: xyz-789
→ Accessible via: Supabase admin dashboard only
```

### After Anu Also Clears
```sql
-- pending_balances table
id: abc-123
cleared_for: ['soumyansh-id', 'anu-id']
→ Visible to: Neither user

-- pending_balances_archive table (ANOTHER RECORD ADDED)
original_balance_id: abc-123
cleared_by: anu-id
cleared_at: 2025-10-04 05:36:00
batch_id: def-456
→ Two archive records for same balance (one per user)
```

## Admin Access to Archives

### Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Login to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. Select `pending_balances_archive` table
4. View all cleared records with full audit trail

### Useful Admin Queries
```sql
-- See all records cleared by a specific user
SELECT * FROM pending_balances_archive
WHERE cleared_by = 'user-id'
ORDER BY cleared_at DESC;

-- See all records cleared in a batch
SELECT * FROM pending_balances_archive
WHERE batch_id = 'batch-uuid';

-- Count total archived records per user
SELECT cleared_by, COUNT(*) as total_cleared
FROM pending_balances_archive
GROUP BY cleared_by;
```

## Files Created
```
supabase-pending-balances-archive-schema.sql
src/app/api/pending-balances/clear-history/route.ts
```

## Files Modified
```
src/lib/types.ts (added cleared_for to PendingBalance interface)
src/lib/supabase.ts (added cleared_for to database types)
src/components/PendingBalancesList.tsx (added Clear button & filtering)
src/components/PendingBalancesSection.tsx (added handleClearHistory)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
# File: supabase-pending-balances-archive-schema.sql
```

### 2. Test the Feature
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Workflow
1. Add a pending balance
2. Mark it as settled
3. Click "Clear History" button
4. Confirm the action
5. Verify settled items disappear from your view
6. Login as partner → Verify they still see it
7. Partner clicks "Clear History" → Now both views are clear
8. Check Supabase admin panel → See archived records

## Security Features

✅ **Archive table**: RLS policy blocks ALL client access
✅ **Admin only**: Accessible via service role / Supabase dashboard only
✅ **User isolation**: Each user can only clear their own view
✅ **Audit trail**: Complete history with timestamps and user tracking
✅ **Batch tracking**: Group all items cleared together

## Key Behaviors

- ✅ Clearing is **per-user** (independent views)
- ✅ Archives created **immediately** on clear
- ✅ Original records **kept** in pending_balances table
- ✅ Multiple archive records possible (one per user clear)
- ✅ Cannot be undone (by design)
- ✅ Partner's view unaffected

## Admin Benefits

1. **Full audit trail**: Who cleared what and when
2. **Batch identification**: See all items cleared together
3. **Data recovery**: Can manually restore if needed
4. **Analytics**: Track clearing patterns
5. **Compliance**: Complete historical record preservation
