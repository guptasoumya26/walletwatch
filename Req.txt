A Simple 2 user Expense Writer
1) Should have 2 user logins
2) Should have monthly views with year
3) lets say User 1 "Soumyansh" does a login, he gets to see current month which is September 2025 
as of now, Now he will simply log whatever expenses he did in house which are share-able between Soumyansh And Anu
4) Now lets say Anu logs in, sees current month as well, logs her own expenses which are share-able between Soumyansh and Anu
5) Below each of the user, Auto total of their expenses should happen
6) Each individual share should be calculated automatically simply by total of both divided by 2
7) Whomsover has paid extra, then how much other user should pay to balance out should be shown
8) Soumyansh cant edit Anu's entry and vice-versa
9) In the end there should be a Simple note section every month where both can write anything miscellaneous
10) Also Monthwise graph should be displayed to see a trend of how are our total expenses going month on month
11) Tech Stack - Next JS, Vercel, Supabase, Dark and Light theme
12) Maintain proper .gitignore, README.md, .env file for secrets, keep securrity intact
13) We need to deploy this on vercel with db on supabase.
